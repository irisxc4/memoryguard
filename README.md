## What's New in v0.7.8

v0.7.8 consolidates the governance, observability, and host-runtime fixes
prepared after v0.7.7:

- **Canonical memory and rule governance:** related rules, habits, and memories
  converge through one canonical read/write path while evidence, source links,
  graph branches, supersede history, conflict review, and settlement remain
  auditable and reversible.
- **Readable multi-agent governance:** verified program identities, readable
  labels, safe family icons, shared-group scope, risk explanations, stale-conflict
  closure, and the seven-page GUI shell keep daily governance understandable.
- **Local usage and savings view:** the Token page shows local MCP conversion
  events and seven-/thirty-day estimated baseline-versus-delivered units.
  Provider token measurements are used only when reported (currently Codex and
  Grok); Claude, Cursor, and Trae remain explicitly unsupported. No conversation
  body, account, path, or instance identifier is stored.
- **Codex lifecycle and runtime alignment:** terminal-thread evidence gates
  reclamation of Codex-owned leaked cohorts; ordinary turns remain resumable.
  Installed repair aligns MCP and lifecycle Hooks to the current interpreter
  while preserving Agent/shared-group identity and fail-closed boundaries.

See [the v0.7.8 release record](docs/releases/v0.7.8.md).

Earlier release details are kept in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and
[GitHub release records](https://github.com/irisxc4/memoryguard/releases).

## Major V2 refactor in v0.6.0

v0.6.0 was a production data-plane refactor, not a storage-only upgrade:

- **Authoritative V2 domains:** Memory, Rules, Evidence, Content, Runtime, Projection, Assets, CodeGraph, Skills, and System state are separated into explicit SQLite domains with governed boundaries.
- **Explicit cutover:** `V1_ACTIVE → V2_BUILDING → V2_READY → V2_ACTIVE` is fail-closed; V2 never silently falls back to legacy stores or dual-writes after READY/ACTIVE.
- **Lossless migration:** frozen-source preparation uses coherent SQLite online backups, validates source/target evidence, rechecks live-source drift, and preserves V1 data plus migration backups for rollback.
- **Native routing:** MCP, CLI, GUI, and Hook surfaces are classified explicitly; the release closed the 233-surface cutover with 138 implemented routes, 95 retired routes, and zero neutral/blocker routes.
- **Governed intelligence:** Rule lifecycle and RuleMerge, extraction/enrichment, External MCP import, provider control-plane, conversation history, Knowledge Library, and GUI governance all use the V2 evidence and decision paths.
- **Operational evidence:** Reference Audit, per-domain SQLite health, guarded maintenance, rollback evidence, and safe unbound diagnostics are part of readiness and operations.

## Why MemoryGuard

Persistent memory solves storage. It does not solve governance.

When several coding agents write into the same context, records become
duplicated, stale, contradictory, over-broad, or unsafe to reuse. MemoryGuard
sits between coding agents and their shared memory to keep that context usable.

| Without governance | With MemoryGuard |
|---|---|
| Notes accumulate without a canonical state | Writes are classified, deduplicated, superseded, or surfaced as conflicts |
| A correction silently destroys the old value | Evidence and supersede chains preserve what changed and why |
| Tokens and credentials can remain active | Sensitive-looking content is quarantined from active memory |
| Every write needs manual approval | Agents write normally; people review exceptions and outcomes |
| Raw chat logs leak into future context | Conversation history remains a separate, explicitly read evidence archive |

## Quick start

### MCP Registry metadata

This package exposes a local stdio MCP server as `io.github.irisxc4/memoryguard`.
The registry metadata is kept in [`server.json`](server.json). The marker above
is required in the PyPI package README. The current `agent-memguard` `0.7.8`
PyPI artifact has no marker, so `0.7.8` still cannot be published to the MCP
Registry. For the next release, first bump both `server.json` versions to the
new package version, publish a marker-bearing PyPI artifact, confirm its
version and marker are visible, then run `mcp-publisher publish`.

### 1. Install

```bash
python -m pip install agent-memguard
```

For the desktop governance console:

```bash
python -m pip install "agent-memguard[gui]"
```

### 2. Authorize the current project

```bash
memoryguard source add .
```

### 3. Connect or repair your coding agent

Global provider configuration is rebuilt from the real binding in the canonical user data home. The command is idempotent and removes superseded MemoryGuard project-level overrides after a successful global takeover.

```bash
# Repair one provider
memoryguard provider repair claude
memoryguard provider repair codex
memoryguard provider repair cursor
memoryguard provider repair trae

# Repair every detected provider
memoryguard provider repair all
```

Restart the host after installation, then verify the integration:

```bash
memoryguard doctor
memoryguard mcp-status
memoryguard hooks status --provider all
```

Launch the desktop console:

```bash
memoryguard gui
```

`memoryguard-gui .` remains available for desktop shortcuts. A bare
`memoryguard gui` always opens the canonical user-level control directory
(default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MemoryGuard` on Windows), so running it from a project
or from `C:\Windows\System32` cannot silently switch databases.
`MEMORYGUARD_WORKSPACE` is an explicit operator override; an explicit
`memoryguard gui <project-path>` or `memoryguard gui --workspace <project-path>`
selects a specific workspace.
It does not remember a previously selected project or open a folder picker.
On Windows, `memoryguard gui` detaches the native window from the terminal, so
closing PowerShell does not close the GUI.

Provider-specific setup and behavior:

- [Claude Code installation](docs/install-claude-code.md)
- [Codex installation](docs/install-codex.md)
- [Cursor installation](docs/install-cursor.md)

### Stable Codex / Router binding

Codex/Router binds MemoryGuard to the stable local Codex program and control
installation. An account profile is an endpoint/alias, not a new memory owner:
switching profiles automatically discovers or repairs the profile and reuses the
verified Agent binding and active group. Request identity remains fail-closed;
this does not share records across machines or with arbitrary accounts.

## Upgrade

MemoryGuard currently upgrades through Python's package manager:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade agent-memguard
memoryguard --version
memoryguard doctor
```

If you installed the GUI extra, keep it during the upgrade:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade "agent-memguard[gui]"
```

There is no package self-update command. The package manager is the
authoritative package-upgrade path; `memoryguard upgrade` below is the explicit
workspace migration flow, not a package updater.

### Upgrade an existing V1 data home

Upgrade the package, then run the verified migration. No workspace, data-home,
apply, or confirmation arguments are required for the normal user-level data
home:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade agent-memguard
memoryguard --version                    # 0.7.8
memoryguard upgrade
memoryguard doctor
```

The command prepares V2, validates the frozen and live source evidence,
migrates Agent/Group control, activates only after all gates pass, and removes
only the backup batch belonging to that successful migration. Re-running it on
`V2_ACTIVE` is idempotent. For a zero-write report, use:

```bash
memoryguard upgrade --preview
```

Advanced explicit workspace/data-home options remain available for operators
managing an isolated installation. A failed gate stays non-active and preserves
its evidence; successful activation does not keep a redundant migration backup.

### Existing pre-V2 workspaces: explicit V2 cutover

v0.6.0 never auto-activates an existing workspace. Upgrade the package first,
then use the packaged operator CLI:

```bash
# Read-only manifest status
memoryguard-v2 status -w .

# Build a frozen-source V2 shadow and stop at V2_READY
memoryguard-v2 prepare -w . --apply

# Activate only after the prepare result is V2_READY / ready=true
memoryguard-v2 activate -w . --confirm V2_ACTIVE
```

The prepare step uses coherent SQLite online backups, preserves V1 and
`migration-backups`, and rechecks live-source drift before READY. Activation
performs another fresh drift check before changing the manifest. Do not delete
legacy V1 data or migration backups as part of the upgrade.

## Knowledge Library

The desktop console can turn a selected folder or file set into one governed
local knowledge library. Source files remain where they are; MemoryGuard stores
the searchable index in its user data home instead of copying a runtime
database into every source project. Knowledge metadata never becomes a second
source-body store.

| Capability | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| File/folder ingestion | Add a folder as a book or selected files as documents |
| Structure | Parse documents, preserve chapter/section context, and create traceable chunks |
| Retrieval | Full-text search, optional embeddings, and a layered knowledge graph |
| Natural synchronization | Re-ingest changed files; a partial or failed scan does not silently remove previously indexed content |
| Lifecycle | Move a book to the library trash, restore it, or explicitly purge its recovery snapshot |
| Memory candidates | Preview evidence-backed candidates before accepting them into governed long-term memory |

Open the desktop console and choose **Knowledge Library**. Remote embedding or
model-backed indexing is opt-in and requires explicit authorization; local
full-text retrieval remains available without sending source text to a remote
provider.

### CodeGraph refresh

The first CodeGraph build is an explicit, confirmed full build. After a scope
has been built, each successful trusted file write can trigger an incremental
refresh for that scope, subject to strict source-path and active-binding
validation. Unchanged content hashes are a no-op; deleted files are retired;
the next context receives one bounded `affected` receipt. MemoryGuard does not
run a daemon or watcher for this path and does not infer paths from shell or
free-form text.

### Desktop console surfaces

The GUI follows a seven-page information architecture:

1. Governance Overview
2. Data Sources & Agents
3. Memory Core
4. CodeGraph
5. Rules & Habits
6. Conversation History
7. Risk Signals & Governance Console

Agent lists use readable program/provider names; the underlying ID remains
available in the detail view. Empty data is shown as an explicit empty state.

The console is not an approval queue. Agents keep moving. MemoryGuard records
the outcome and exposes the evidence needed to correct it later.

## What you can govern

| Signal | Governance action |
|---|---|
| Duplicate or stale memory | Inspect the canonical record and supersede chain; restore an earlier version when needed |
| Conflicting memories | Keep both visible until the conflict is resolved deliberately |
| Secrets, tokens, or credentials | Quarantine the record so it cannot enter active shared memory |
| Incorrect automatic organization | Correct, merge, lock, restore, or roll back with evidence |
| Multiple coding agents | Bind agents to one shared group while preserving source identity and scope |
| Mandatory rules | Assign rules to an Agent, project, provider, runtime role, or shared group |

## Rules and history stay separate

MemoryGuard deliberately keeps governed long-term memory and raw conversation
history on different paths.

| Surface | Purpose | Context behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Rules and habits** | Preferences, procedures, corrections, facts, projects, and scoped mandatory rules | Mandatory rules use an independent char/token budget after scope, exclude, conflict, and semantic dedup. Effective count above 20 is a health warning, not a hard block; storage is not capped by count. Sensitive, corrupt, per-item oversize, and aggregate overflow still fail closed with no silent truncation. Ordinary records are recalled when relevant |
| **Conversation history** | Local raw-evidence archive with owner and shared-group access controls | Never enters bootstrap automatically; raw text is read only through explicit history tools |
| **Neuron graph** | Navigation and governance over memory, rules, projects, agents, and sessions | History nodes contain safe metadata and summaries, not raw chat content |

History retrieval is progressive: search results, then a bounded timeline, then
an explicitly selected turn or session. Extracting from history creates a
preview first; it does not silently write a long-term memory.

## Supported hosts

| Host | Integration | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Global MCP binding, redirect rules, user-level lifecycle Hook | Verified takeover path |
| Codex | Global MCP binding, redirect rules, user-level lifecycle Hook | Verified takeover path |
| Cursor | Global MCP binding, redirect rules, user-level lifecycle Hook | Verified takeover path |
| TRAE | MCP binding and redirect rules | No verified Hook seam; reported as a fallback instead of full takeover |

Provider status is reported honestly as redirected, observed, operational, or
unsupported. MemoryGuard does not claim it can disable every host's native
memory when the host exposes no reliable integration point.

## Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Evidence & Content** | Authorized sources, immutable evidence, content-addressed blobs/occurrences, source manifests, and conversation archives |
| **Memory & Rules** | Scoped memory atoms, revisions, bindings, rule definitions, decisions, evidence links, and compensating governance operations |
| **Runtime & Projection** | Bounded working context, scenario/profile projections, CodeGraph, Assets, and Skills metadata |
| **Cutover & Governance** | Four-state manifest, native MCP/CLI/GUI/Hook routing, Reference Audit, maintenance, provider adapters, and rollback evidence |

V2 uses separate authoritative SQLite domains rather than one shared-memory
database. The runtime reads and writes V2 only after the manifest reaches
`V2_ACTIVE`; `V2_BUILDING` and `V2_READY` never silently fall back or dual-write.
Evidence remains traceable without being treated as automatically trusted memory.

## Privacy and safety

- MemoryGuard runs as a local MCP stdio server.
- All governed data stays local unless you explicitly authorize a remote model
  or embedding operation. Optional usage telemetry is local-only: its measured
  host token events and deterministic conversion events are stored under
  `.memoryguard/usage_telemetry.sqlite`; it does not upload data. Token savings
  are estimates based on MemoryGuard deterministic units, not a provider billing
  statement. Hosts without token reporting remain unsupported in the measured
  columns.
- The Knowledge Library database uses `MEMORYGUARD_HOME` or the platform user
  data directory, so a selected source folder does not receive its own
  knowledge database.
- V2 authoritative workspace state is separated under `.memoryguard/` into
  explicit Memory, Rules, Evidence, Content, Runtime, Projection, Assets,
  CodeGraph, Skills, and System domains; History, Source, Binding, and Group
  control are V2-native surfaces. Legacy V1 artifacts are preserved as local
  rollback/audit evidence after cutover and are no longer the active V2 runtime
  write path; only `memoryguard.migration` may read them.
- Source scanning is read-only by default.
- Mutating governance paths use validation, explicit scope, provenance, and
  reversible state.
- Quarantined records stay outside active shared memory.
- Raw conversation history is never injected into bootstrap automatically.
- Shared-group history access follows current active membership and does not
  grant deletion rights over another Agent's source.

## CLI

The installed `memoryguard` command exposes these top-level operations:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `audit [path]` | Run a read-only audit and generate a report |
| `open [path]` | Open the latest interactive report |
| `explain <finding_id>` | Explain evidence and risk for a finding |
| `source <action>` | List, add, remove, or preview authorized sources |
| `scan` | Scan authorized sources and build the coverage ledger |
| `doctor` | Diagnose V2 manifest, domain availability, and native coverage |
| `mcp-status` | Inspect V2 MCP/backend health; tenant counts require a bound Agent scope |
| `hooks <action>` | Install, inspect, pause, repair, or remove host Hooks |
| `provider <action>` | Inspect or repair global provider integrations |
| `storage audit|report` | Run read-only V2 Reference Audit and per-domain SQLite health reports |
| `storage sweep|compact` | Run guarded V2 maintenance; physical changes require ACTIVE state, lease, generation, and safety proofs |
| `groups <action>` | Inspect governed group state |
| `gui [path]` | Launch the interactive governance console |
| `desktop` | Launch the trusted desktop executor |

The old V1 `plan`, `apply`, `verify`, `undo`, `import`, and `gc` workflows may
remain parseable as explicit retired compatibility surfaces, but are not a V1
runtime path. Under `V2_ACTIVE` they return a stable retired result instead of
writing through a legacy store. Legacy data input is accepted only by the
explicit `memoryguard.migration` upgrade flow.

Run `memoryguard --help` or `memoryguard <command> --help` for the live command
reference.

## MCP API

The MCP server exposes tools for:

- governed memory read, search, write, update, delete, and status;
- bounded context bootstrap with mandatory-rule isolation;
- rule creation, feedback, merge governance, undo, and scope statistics;
- Agent binding and shared-group inspection;
- source scanning, graph projection, import previews, and build planning;
- external MCP discovery and import;
- document extraction previews and candidate acceptance;
- conversation-history search, timeline, explicit read, export, deletion, and
  extraction preview;
- provider installation and host-agent enrichment.

Use MCP `tools/list` as the source of truth for the exact tool set supported by
the installed version.

## Roadmap

- **Current release line:** v0.7.8 consolidates canonical governance, readable multi-agent GUI governance, local-only usage telemetry, and Codex lifecycle/runtime alignment. v0.7.7 makes bare provider repair safe in a verified, uniquely bound control home and aligns installed Codex MCP/Hook repairs to the current interpreter while preserving Agent and shared-group identity. v0.7.6 makes Codex Hook/MCP runtime selection consistent through one immutable snapshot, shortens Hook state lock windows, and keeps bootstrap success/failure state honest with explicit mandatory-overflow fail-closed handling. Earlier release records retain the detailed v0.7.5 conflict-review, v0.7.4 canonical-governance, v0.7.3 shared-history, and v0.7.2 write/read and Codex lifecycle changes. The
  v0.7.1 V2-only migration and desktop lifecycle work remains documented as
  historical release context.
- **Acceptance boundary:** the Graphify evidence is the focused `3 / 3` result
  plus the real full-repository export/projection described above. It does not
  claim that upstream Graphify's full-repository test suite passed.
- **Next after release:** broader CodeGraph/Skills ingestion, more operator-friendly
  maintenance reports, and additional migration observability. Long-term records
  are not retired merely because they are old.
- **Later:** team and enterprise capabilities only after validated demand.
